# Finance-Fraud-Detection

## Overview

This repository houses the implementation of a fraud detection and monitoring system. The project aims to address the increasing concerns around financial fraud, especially in the realm of credit card transactions. With consumers reporting substantial losses to fraud, and credit card fraud being a prevalent issue, the need for robust anti-fraud technologies is evident. This system utilizes data from various sources, including transactional characteristics, customer behaviors, and machine learning outputs, to provide insights that aid in mitigating the risk of fraud.

## Data Exploration

In the initial phase of the project, a comprehensive data exploration was conducted. The key insights obtained are as follows:

1. **Gender Distribution:** Explored how the data is distributed based on the gender of the customer.

2. **Number of Credit Cards per User:** Investigated the distribution of the number of credit cards held by each user.

3. **Card Categories and Dark Web Presence:** Analyzed the number of cards in each category and explored whether they appeared on the dark web.

4. **Data Balance:** Discovered that the data is imbalanced and implemented oversampling and undersampling techniques to address this issue.

## Models

Three different models were employed in the fraud detection system:

### 1. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a linear model used for binary classification tasks. In our fraud detection system, it serves as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability. It models the probability of fraud occurrence based on input features and is trained using gradient descent.

#### Strengths:
- **Interpretability:** Logistic Regression provides a clear interpretation of the relationship between features and the probability of fraud.
- **Efficiency:** It is computationally efficient and suitable for large datasets.
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and serves as a baseline model.

#### Limitations:
- **Linearity:** Assumes a linear relationship between features, which may not capture complex patterns.
- **Limited Expressiveness:** May struggle with capturing intricate interactions between variables.

### 2. Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It excels in handling complex relationships within the data and is robust to noisy features. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize its performance for fraud detection.

#### Strengths:
- **High Accuracy:** Random Forest excels in achieving high accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees.
- **Feature Importance:** Provides a measure of feature importance, aiding in understanding the key factors influencing predictions.
- **Robustness:** Resistant to overfitting and performs well with noisy data.

#### Limitations:
- **Complexity:** Can be computationally expensive and may require tuning of numerous hyperparameters.
- **Black Box:** Interpretability may be a challenge due to the ensemble nature of the model.

### 3. Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier
The Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier is a neural network with multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. It's capable of learning complex patterns in the data. Hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting the number of layers and neurons, was performed to enhance its ability to detect fraudulent activities.

#### Strengths:
- **Non-linearity:** Capable of capturing non-linear relationships in the data through hidden layers.
- **Representation Learning:** Learns hierarchical representations, allowing for feature extraction.
- **Adaptability:** Suitable for complex tasks and diverse datasets.

#### Limitations:
- **Computational Intensity:** Training deep neural networks can be computationally demanding.
- **Overfitting:** Prone to overfitting, especially with insufficient data or inadequate regularization.
- **Interpretability:** The model's decision-making process might be challenging to interpret.

### Model Evaluation

Based on accuracy and confusion matrix analysis, the Random Forest Classifier outperformed other methods on the test data.

## Future work

While the current implementation provides a strong foundation for fraud detection, there are several avenues for future exploration and improvement:

### 1. Experiment with Different Neural Network Architectures
Explore alternative architectures for the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier. Consider adjusting the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, and activation functions to discover potential improvements in model performance.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Investigate the inclusion of additional features or the creation of new features that might capture more nuanced patterns of fraudulent behavior. Feature engineering can significantly impact the model's ability to discern fraudulent transactions.

### 3. Ensemble Models
Experiment with ensemble models that combine the strengths of multiple algorithms. Creating an ensemble of different models, including variations of neural networks and traditional machine learning algorithms, may result in a more robust and accurate fraud detection system.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Conduct a more extensive hyperparameter search for all models. Fine-tune the parameters of each model to optimize performance. This includes exploring grid search or random search techniques to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
